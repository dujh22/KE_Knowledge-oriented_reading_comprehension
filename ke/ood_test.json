    "passage": "Angel is the sixth album by the British folk - rock band Fairport .This was the first Fairport Convention album without guitarist Richard , and the lineup consisted of Simon ( guitar , vocals ) ( the only original group member ) , [person X] ( violin , vocals ) , Dave Pegg ( bass , vocals ) , and Dave Mattacks ( drums ) .The title derives from \" The Angel \" in Little Hadham , Hertfordshire , a former pub which the band were living in at the time , and the eponymous track is autobiographical , referring to \" John the Wood \" ( co - producer ) , \" Dave the Drum \" ( Mattacks ) , and even details such as \" peer through the haze watching Top of the Pops \" .The band moved out of The Angel shortly after the album 's release , partly because a lorry had run , out of control , into [person X] 's bedroom .The U.K. album cover included liner notes consisting of dialogue among band members and roadies preparing to leave \" The Angel \" for a gig , that was replaced on American and Canadian copies by a more straightforward , biographical liner essay .Musically , Angel progressed little from its predecessors , although an appearance on Top of the Pops as a featured album contributed to its chart success ; it reached number eight on the UK Album chart , making it the band 's highest charting album in the UK .",

    "passage": "High priest ( kohen gadol ; with definite article ha'kohen ha'gadol , the high priest ; Aramaic kahana rabba ) was the title of the chief religious official of Judaism from the early post - Exilic times until the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE .Previously , in the Israelite religion including the time of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah , other terms were used to designate the leading priests ; however , as long as a king was in place , the supreme ecclesiastical authority lay with him .The official introduction of the term \" high priest \" went hand in hand with a greatly enhanced ritual and political significance bestowed upon the chief priest in the post - Exilic period , certainly from 411 BCE onward , after the religious transformations brought about by the Babylonian captivity and due to the lack of a Jewish king and kingdom .The high priests belonged to the Jewish priestly families that trace their paternal line back to Aaron , the first high priest of Israel in the Hebrew and elder brother of [Character B] , through Zadok , a leading priest at the time of David and Solomon .This tradition came to an end in the 2nd century BCE during the rule of the Hasmoneans , when the position was occupied by other priestly families unrelated to Zadok .",

    "passage": "Midnight is a 1983 album by [human A] .This would be the final Meat Loaf release under Epic Records until The Very Best of Meat Loaf ( 1998 ) .Following a dispute with his former songwriter Jim Steinman , [human A] was contractually obliged to release a new album .According to [human A] , Steinman gave him \" Total Eclipse of the Heart \" and \" Making Love Out of Nothing at All \" for the album , but [human A] 's record company refused to pay for Steinman .The songs Steinman had given to [human A] were then given to Bonnie Tyler and Air Supply respectively , which both became hits in their respective countries and worldwide .Struggling for time and with no resolution to his arguments with Steinman seemingly on the horizon ( eventually , Steinman and [human A] would sue one another ) , he was forced to find songwriters wherever he could , including writing the songs himself .[Human A] is credited with being involved in the writing of numerous tracks on the album , including the title track .However , as [human A] would later admit , he was not much of a songwriter and did not like the songs he had written for the album .It was also regarded by fans and critics alike as a poor effort whether compared to previous releases or on its own merit .Those same fans and critics were disappointed to see that the iconic pictures on the covers of Bat Out of Hell and Dead Ringer were replaced by a black - and - white photograph of [human A] .( On some later re - releases , a color image of a screaming [human A] was used as the cover image . )",

    "passage": "In music , a fugue ( ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices , built on a subject ( a musical theme ) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation ( repetition at different pitches ) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition .It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune , which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American ( i.e.shape note or \" Sacred Harp \" ) music and West Gallery music .A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition , a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue 's tonic key .Some fugues have a recapitulation .In the Middle Ages , the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance , it had come to denote specifically imitative works .Since the 17th century , the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint .Most fugues open with a short main theme , the subject , which then sounds successively in each voice ( after the first voice is finished stating the subject , a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch , and other voices repeat in the same way ) ; when each voice has entered , the exposition is complete .This is often followed by a connecting passage , or episode , developed from previously heard material ; further \" entries \" of the subject then are heard in related keys .Episodes ( if applicable ) and entries are usually alternated until the \" final entry \" of the subject , by which point the music has returned to the opening key , or tonic , which is often followed by closing material , the coda .In this sense , a fugue is a style of composition , rather than a fixed structure .The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions , such as imitative ricercars , capriccios , canzonas , and fantasias .The famous fugue composer Johann ( 1685\u20131750 ) shaped his own works after those of Johann ( 1616 \u2013 1667 ) , Johann Pachelbel ( 1653 \u2013 1706 ) , Girolamo Frescobaldi ( 1583 \u2013 1643 ) , Dieterich Buxtehude ( c. 1637\u20131707 ) and others .With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period , the fugue 's central role waned , eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position .Nevertheless , composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of [Person A] ( 1756 \u2013 1791 ) and Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770 \u2013 1827 ) , as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 \u2013 1975 ) .",

    "passage": "The De Legibus ( On the Laws ) is a dialogue written by Marcus Tullius Cicero during the last years of the Roman Republic .It bears the same name as Plato \u2019s famous dialogue , The Laws .Unlike his previous work de re publica , in which Cicero felt compelled to set the action in the times of Scipio Africanus Minor , Cicero wrote this work as a fictionalized dialogue between himself , his brother Quintus and their mutual friend Titus Pomponius Atticus .The dialogue begins with the trio taking a leisurely stroll through Cicero 's familial estate at Arpinum and they begin to discuss how the laws should be .Cicero uses this as a platform for expounding on his theories of natural law of harmony among the classes .The three remaining books ( out of an indeterminate number , although Jonathan Powell and Niall Rudd in their translation for Oxford seem to argue that it may have been six , to bring it in line with the number in de re publica ) , in order , expound on Cicero 's beliefs in Natural Law , recasts the religious laws of Rome ( in reality a rollback to the religious laws under the king [apocryphal human A] ) and finally talk of his proposed reforms to the Roman Constitution .Whether or not the work was meant as an earnest plan of action is unknown .Cicero 's basic conservative and traditionalist beliefs led him to imagine an idealized Rome before the Gracchi , with the classes still in harmony .From there , he reformed the worst points of the Roman constitution , while keeping the majority of it .Cicero 's proposed constitution in Book Three must be seen as a renovation of the existing order , not a call to shatter the order and build anew .However , less than a decade after the accepted date for his beginning the manuscript , Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon , launching the civil war that would end the Republic .",

    "passage": "Hans ( 3 July 1912 \u2013 25 February 2008 ) was an advocate , jurist and judge .He entered the Indian judiciary in 1952 and subsequently was elevated as a judge to the Supreme Court of India in 1971 where he continued till his resignation in 1977 .Two of his judgements form the basis of modern constitutional law in India , even decades after those were delivered .He is noted for his minority judgement in the highly publicized Habeas Corpus case during the Indian Emergency , in which the remaining four judges of the bench , Chief Justice A. N. Ray , Justice M. H. Beg , Justice Y. V. Chandrachud and Justice P. N. Bhagwati , agreed with the governmental view that even the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of India like the right to life stood abrogated during the period of national emergency .Khanna 's judgement was the only dissenting vote , and his opinion , claiming that the Constitution could not possibly intend to make the fundamental rights to life and liberty to be subjected to executive decree for these are inalienable to one 's life and dignified existence , is widely extolled as a show of judicial valor in defending the fundamental rights to life and liberty in the Indian democracy .In January 1977 , after delivering the Habeas Corpus judgement , he was superseded for the post of Chief Justice by Justice M. H. Beg at the behest of the then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi , despite being the senior - most judge in the Supreme Court and as a result of this , he promptly resigned from the court .Khanna had previously authored the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution of India in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala , which curtailed Parliament 's seemingly unfettered amending power under article 368 , restricting its scope of amendment in areas which were part of the Constitution 's \" basic structure \" .After resigning from the Supreme Court on getting superseded by Justice M. H. Beg to the office of the Chief Justice of India , he served as the central minister of law and justice for a very short period and was later made a combined opposition - sponsored candidate for election as President in 1982 , losing to Zail Singh .In 1999 , he was awarded the [honor K] , the second highest civilian honour given by the Government of India .",
