 'Historiographic metafiction is a term coined by Canadian literary theorist Linda Hutcheon in the late 1980s .The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of metafiction with historical fiction .Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic , historical and literary texts ( i.e.intertextuality ) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and historiography are dependent on the history of discourse .The term is closely associated with works of postmodern literature , usually novels .According to Hutcheon , in " A Poetics of Postmodernism " , works of historiographic metafiction are " those well - known and popular novels which are both intensely self - reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages " .Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include : William Shakespeare \'s Pericles , Prince of Tyre ( c.1608 ) , John Fowles \' The French Lieutenant \'s Woman ( 1969 ) , E. L. Doctorow \'s Ragtime ( 1975 ) , William Kennedy \'s Legs ( 1975 ) , Salman Rushdie \'s Midnight \'s Children ( 1981 ) , A. S.

 'The Hauka movement was a religious movement which arose in French Colonial Africa .It consisted of ceremonies , including mimicry and dancing , in which the participants performed the elaborate military ceremonies of their colonial occupiers .It was depicted in Les Maîtres Fous ( The Mad Masters – 1955 ) , a short film directed by Jean , a well - known French film director and ethnologist .According to some anthropologists , the movement was a form of resistance that began in <mask> ( Country ) , but spread to other parts of Africa .According to some anthropologists , this pageant , though historic , was largely done to mock their authority by stealing their powers .Hauka members were not trying to emulate Europeans , but were trying to extract their life force .This stance has been heavily criticized by anthropologist James G.
